# recipes
This project will showcase a basic understanding of HTML elements demonstrated in a Recipe website with links to different recipes.

HTML:
I practiced boilerplate structure when formatting the pages including doctype, html, head, meta, and body tags.
I nested meta tags within the head which are hidden from the page that include the language type which makes it readable to the browser.

I used the same structure for each recipe page, which allowed me to copy/paste the basic skeleton of the pages and fill with content.
