        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>There's nothing quite like a homemade steak. Seared and savory, carmelized and buttery. Ribeye combines the succulent, richness of the fat with tender beef. Coupled with smashed garlic cloves and fresh thyme, this dish is sure to satisfy the beef crave.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (24oz) bone-in ribeye steak, 2 inch thick, at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.</li>
                <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
                <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
                <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
                <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season generously with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot, about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.</li>
                <li>Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, until a dark crust has formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to opposite side of the skillet, tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
