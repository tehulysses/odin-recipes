            <p>A classic English pub fare, Fish and Chips golden fried, served with cripsy chips and tartar sauce, if you so please.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p><strong>For the Fish:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>7 tbsp (55 grams) all-purpose flour, divided</li>
                <li>7 tbsp (55 grams) cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>Sea salt, to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1/3 cup dark beer, cold</li>
                <li>4 (7oz) fish fillets (thick, white fish)</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>For the Chips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>1 quart (1 liter) vegetable oil, or lard, for frying</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season generously with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot, about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.</li>
                <li>Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, until a dark crust has formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to opposite side of the skillet, tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
